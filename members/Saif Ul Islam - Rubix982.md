Hi, I’m Saif!

I’m currently from Pakistan, going into my final year at FAST NUCES, Karachi, majoring in Computer Science. My technical expertise currently lies with Data Science, Backend Engineering,Software Engineering, Open Source technologies, a little bit of Frontend design here and there. I've touched DevOps tools such as Docker, K8s, Docker Compose, Git, GitHub Actions, and Azure Pipelines. As of right now, I’m fixated on developing skills for Cloud/DevOps/Networking and System Administration. I would like to get deep into Site Reliability Engineering/Production Engineering, and maybe even pursue DevSecOps.

I've worked with MERN stack, Django, MySQL, Mongo, Neo4j, APIs such as the FB / Messenger API, Twilio API, learned a bit of the Cloud on GCP / Qwiklabs, learned about DevOps, CI/CD, TDD. See more tools down below. I also have specializations in Deep Learning from deeplearning.ai, and the Tensorflow Professional Practitioner certification under Laurence Moroney.

My current plans in my free time for the coming Summer at the moment are to (hopefully),

1. Get a research paper published
2. Finish a Big Data, an Apache Spark and a course from Coursere
3. Read a few books I have in mind, and maybe write blogs about them!

I'm currently an Open-Source Fellow at MLH, working as a developer on Mapillary, under Facebook.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about #bigdata, #opensource, #dataengineering, #softwaredevelopment, #webdev - you can book a calendly as well.

Thank you, and cheers!
